# 🔐 AI-Based Phishing Website Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects phishing websites using Machine Learning.
It uses website features such as URL length and HTTPS presence to classify whether a website is **Legitimate** or **Phishing**.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Algorithm

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Load phishing dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Apply StandardScaler for feature scaling
4. Train Random Forest Classifier
5. Evaluate model using:
   - Accuracy
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
6. Save trained model
7. Predict new website input
